                This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the WackoPicko
                 Services. By using the WackoPicko Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" 
                (which means that you simply browse or use the Site, including through a mobile device, or otherwise use the 
                WackoPicko Services without being registered) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with WackoPicko).  
                The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to access this Site or to use the WackoPicko 
                Services, including materials and services contained in the Site (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) 
                if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and the terms of this Agreement.  Please read this Agreement carefully and save it.  
                If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to follow all applicable laws, you should leave the Site and discontinue use 
                of the WackoPicko Services immediately.  If you wish to make use of the WackoPicko Services, read this Agreement and reaffirm 
                your acceptance during the registration process.
                </p>
                <p >
                This Agreement includes WackoPicko's policy for acceptable use of the WackoPicko Services and Content 
                (as defined in Section 6.1 below) posted on or through the WackoPicko Services and your rights, obligations 
                and restrictions regarding your use of the WackoPicko Services and Content posted on or through the WackoPicko 
                Services.  In order to participate in certain WackoPicko Services, you may be notified that you are required to 
                download software or content and/or agree to additional terms and conditions from WackoPicko.  Unless otherwise 
                provided by the additional terms and conditions applicable to the WackoPicko Services in which you choose to participate, 
                those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.  
                </p>
                <p >
                WackoPicko may modify or amend this Agreement without notice at any time and such modification will be effective 
                upon posting by WackoPicko on the Site.  Your continued use of the WackoPicko Services after WackoPicko posts a 
                revised Agreement signifies your acceptance of the revised Agreement.  It is therefore important that you review this 
                Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
                </p>
                <p >
                Please choose carefully the information you post on or through the WackoPicko Services and that you make available 
                directly or indirectly to other Users.  Your WackoPicko profile and any Content that you upload to WackoPicko may 
                not include any form of Prohibited Content, as outlined in Section 8 below.  Despite this prohibition, information, 
                materials, products or services provided by other WackoPicko Users (for instance, in their profile or images/videos)

                deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the WackoPicko Services if WackoPicko determines, 
                in its sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement or pose a threat to WackoPicko and/or its Users.
                </p>

                unauthorized solicitation may be removed from images, videos and/or Member profiles without notice or explanation and may result 
                in termination of Membership privileges.  WackoPicko reserves the right to take appropriate legal action for any illegal or 
                unauthorized use of the WackoPicko Services.</p></li>

                        <li><p><strong>6.1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;WackoPicko does not claim any ownership rights in the text,

                        (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the WackoPicko Services.  By displaying or publishing ("posting") 
                        any Content on or through the WackoPicko Services, you hereby grant to WackoPicko and other users a non-exclusive, fully 
                        paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, 
                        reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats 
                        through any media channels, except Content marked "private" will not be distributed outside the WackoPicko Services. 
                        WackoPicko and/or other Users may copy, print or display publicly available Content outside of the WackoPicko Services, 
                        including without limitation, via the Site or third party websites or applications (for example, services allowing Users 
                        to order prints of Content or t-shirts and similar items containing Content).  After you remove your Content from the 
                        WackoPicko Website we will cease distribution as soon as practicable, and at such time when distribution ceases, the 
                        license to such Content will terminate.  If after we have distributed your Content outside the WackoPicko Website you 
                        change the Contentâ€™s privacy setting to "private," we will cease any further distribution of such "private" Content outside 
                        the WackoPicko Website as soon as practicable.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted 
                        by you on or through the WackoPicko Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) 
                        the posting and use of your Content on or through the WackoPicko Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, 
                        copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content 
                        on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party.  You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and 
                        any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the WackoPicko Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The WackoPicko Services contain Content of WackoPicko 
                        ("WackoPicko Content").  WackoPicko Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and 
                        WackoPicko owns and retains all rights in the WackoPicko Content and the WackoPicko Services.  WackoPicko hereby grants you a 
                        limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the WackoPicko Content (excluding any software code) solely 
                        for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the WackoPicko Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The WackoPicko Services contain Content of Users and other WackoPicko 
                        licensors.  Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, 
                        perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the WackoPicko Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;WackoPicko performs technical functions necessary to offer the 
                        WackoPicko Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the 
                        WackoPicko Services.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>6.6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Site and other WackoPicko Services are normally available, 
                        there will be occasions when the Site or other WackoPicko Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, 
                        for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of WackoPicko. 
                        Also, although WackoPicko will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, WackoPicko reserves the right to delete 
                        any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by WackoPicko in order to comply with certain legal 
                        obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, WackoPicko encourages you to maintain your own backup 
                        of your Content. In other words, WackoPicko is not a backup service.  WackoPicko will not be liable to you for any modification, 
                        suspension, or discontinuation of the WackoPicko Services, or the loss of any Content.</p></li>

                        reason, including Content that in the sole judgment of WackoPicko violates this Agreement or which may be offensive, illegal or 
                        violate the rights of any person or entity, or harm or threaten the safety of any person or entity. WackoPicko assumes no 
                        responsibility for monitoring the WackoPicko Services for inappropriate Content or conduct.  However, on both free and PRO 
                        accounts, and regardless of whether the Content is public or private, WackoPicko may choose to monitor such Content at any time, 
                        in its sole discretion. If at any time WackoPicko chooses to monitor the WackoPicko Services, WackoPicko nonetheless assumes no 
                        responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct 
                        of the User submitting any such Content.</p></li>
